### My Project Introduction

And my work is to design the visual software to detect where the piston's location and the direction of the pistons and then listen IP port to transport the infomation of detected piston to the robot arm. The robot arm recieved the info and then take the steps to tune the piston's pose and then put the piston on the product line.
